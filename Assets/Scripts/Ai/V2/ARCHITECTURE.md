# AI Strategy V2 — Architecture (ARCH-02)

This document is **normative**. The original V2 pipeline (phase ordering, decision
authority, score/resource/lifecycle semantics) is unchanged; ARCH-02 only
consolidates *ownership* — which class/file/folder owns which responsibility — so
that new objectives, missions, cards, equipment, generated-card mechanics and
skills/effects have an obvious place to live.

## Folder taxonomy (semantic ownership, not assembly boundaries)

Everything stays in namespace `Game.Ai.V2` (flat). Folders express ownership only.

| Folder | Owns |
|---|---|
| `Orchestration/` | Turn *ordering* only. No scoring, capacity, placement or eligibility logic. |
| `Foundation/` | Cross-cutting config, enums, shared low-level primitives. |
| `State/` | Turn-scoped registries, ledgers, reservations, commitments, budgets. Mutated only through each type's explicit lifecycle API. |
| `Analysis/` | Read-only world scan and derived facts. One coherent `WorldSnapshot`. |
| `Strategy/Desire/` | Axis desire intensities → radar. |
| `Strategy/Objectives/` | Concrete known opportunities per axis. |
| `Strategy/Demand/` | Missing capability detection. **Never selects cards.** |
| `Strategy/` (root) | Phase-A / Phase-B coordination, maintenance & pressure policy. |
| `Evaluation/Cards/` | The single strategic card scoring entry point (`StrategicCardEvaluator`). |
| `Evaluation/Effects/` | `StrategicEffectRegistry` — canonical skills/effects semantic bridge. |
| `Evaluation/Power/` | `AiPower` — canonical own-force power. |
| `Materialization/` | Chain enumeration, placement options, plan, cost, consumption, delivery, execution. |
| `Missions/` | Objective → `MissionProposal` planners + admission. `Missions/Raid/` for raid assembly. |
| `Allocation/` | The one `ResourceAllocator`. |
| `Provisioning/` | Funded mission → actor binding → assembly → provisioned mission. Never plays strategic cards. |
| `Reaction/` | Interrupt lifecycle coordinator + probe/witness/reservation/solver/executor. |
| `Execution/` | Plan → canonical gameplay calls → structured result. Never re-plans or re-scores. |
| `Continuity/` | Mission intent lifecycle: `ResolveActive` (before planning) and `Reconcile` (after execution). |
| `Housekeeping/` | Turn-final, task-neutral, zero-AP local force packaging and invariant repair. It may sort/fold same-hex rosters against world-snapshot combat benchmarks, but never selects objectives, creates missions, moves armies, plays cards or spends resources. |
| `Recon/` | Recon-mission machinery (route/step planning, scout pricing, air/ground policy). |
| `Diagnostics/` | Logging, telemetry, audit. No influence on ordering, score, eligibility or state. |

## Dependency direction (must hold)

```
Orchestration
   ↓
Strategy / Materialization / Missions / Allocation / Provisioning / Reaction / Continuity
   ↓
Analysis / Evaluation / Foundation / State
   ↓
Game domain
```

Forbidden edges: `Evaluator → StrategicManager`, `Domain → MissionPlanner`,
`Executor → ObjectiveEvaluator`, `Demand → MaterializationExecutor`, and any
cycle across the tiers above. `Execution/` receives concrete plans and calls
canonical game actions; it never selects objectives or invents alternative actions.

## Mid-turn loop boundary (rollout contract)

The loop is a bounded repetition of the existing horizontal pipeline, not a new
vertical manager. Ownership remains:

| Level | Mid-turn responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Orchestration/` | Chooses the next admitted task family, enforces turn/cycle/step bounds and stops. No scoring. |
| `Analysis/` | Refreshes `WorldSnapshot`, compares the previous observation with the new one and reports factual deltas. Domain event/reward code never depends on V2. |
| `Strategy/` | Maps typed factual invalidations to dirty task families and re-runs only the existing affected policy. |
| `State/` | Keeps turn-scoped reservations, commitments, state version and persistent no-op parking across cycles. |
| Existing executors | Execute one admitted atomic task step through canonical gameplay calls and return one structured result. They never re-plan. |
| `Reaction/` | End-of-turn safety net, bounded external-interrupt fallback and final reconciliation; not the ordinary post-step loop owner. |

A **task step** contains at most one canonical state-changing gameplay operation,
or one explicit no-op/blocked result. Its executor must wait until that operation
and any battle/event consequence have settled before returning. Only then may
Analysis refresh observations and produce typed invalidations. This preserves
method atomicity: the loop surrounds existing operations; it does not yield from
inside their mutation boundary.

| Lifetime | Starts | Ends | May survive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turn | V2 turn entry | final reconciliation / end turn | reservations, commitments, mission intent, parking |
| Cycle | refreshed observation + dirty-family admission | one bounded task selection/replan pass | turn-owned state only |
| Step | admitted task result is selected | execution settles and result is observed | no executor-local planning state |

Phase A and Phase B are not deleted. Their existing policies remain the owners of
capability fulfilment and surplus/tempo arbitration. During rollout they are
re-entered only through bounded adapters and retain turn-scoped parking/reservation
state; the terminal Phase-B/reaction path remains the final safety net. The initial
rollout scope excludes Aggression through the existing `AiStrategyV2Scope` gate,
so the current Full/Aggression batch path remains available while Recon/Development
is validated.

| AP entitlement split | `State/AxisBudgetLedger` (AP-only) |
| Turn tempo budget | `State/StrategicTempoBudget` |

## Verified boundary invariants (02F–02H audit)

* **One `ResourceAllocator`** — no per-mission/per-axis allocator.
* **One `StrategicCardEvaluator`** — no `Hero`/`Reaction`/`PhaseB`/`Aviation` card scorer.
* **Executors do not plan or rescore** — `Execution/TaskExecutor`, `ReconGroundExecutor` and
  `ReactionRoundExecutor` call canonical gameplay actions and return a structured result; the
  only evaluator calls are `Is*SatisfiedLive` completion checks (a legit §37 concern), never
  objective selection or replacement-mission synthesis (the stale-Explore replacement builder
  was removed — a stale-goal Scout is recorded and re-targeted by Continuity next pass).
* **Air recon Assignment/Execution split (round 4).** WHICH air actor (an existing ready standalone
  wing) or WHICH airfield+launch-subset serves a funded Observation (Refresh / non-stealth Surveil)
  mission is decided by `Recon/ReconAssignmentPlanner.AppendAirCandidates` — the SAME single
  Assignment owner, and the same batch one-actor-per-job solver, Ground candidates already go
  through (`BuildCandidates` / `AssignFunded`; `ScoutExecutorKind.AirExisting` / `AirLaunch` on
  `ScoutExecutionCandidate`). Feasibility reuses `ReconAirReservationPrepass.SlotWouldFly` — the
  same primitive the pre-Demand capacity sizing prepass uses — so the two can never diverge into two
  different feasibility answers for the same question. `Provisioning/ProvisioningManager.ProvisionAir`
  claims the concrete actor/subset the same way ground Provisioning claims a ground mover, producing
  a `ProvisionedMission` tagged with `ExecutorKind`/`AirfieldHex`/`LaunchSubset`. Air never satisfies
  Explore/GroundTraversal and never a stealth-Required / positive-DetectionRisk mission — both hard
  invariants are enforced in `AppendAirCandidates` before any candidate is built.
  The shared allocator deliberately does not apply Recon's ground `HardCap`, because executor kind
  is unknown there. `ReconAssignmentPlanner` applies that cap only to ground-bound candidates and
  preserves the independent `MaxAirReconActorsPerTurn` ceiling for aviation, including across
  provisioning re-packs. Thus air observation may run in addition to the allowed ground lanes.
  Air recon stays plan-then-execute for the *tactical* half. `Recon/AirReconPlanner.Plan` no longer
  selects; it turns this pass's air-bound `ProvisionedMission`s (plus wings already continuing a
  prior sortie, which are Mission Continuity's concern, not fresh Assignment's) into an `AirReconPlan`
  — re-deriving the concrete first step/landing/score fresh via `PickFromStorage` against current
  world state (legitimate live execution-input assembly, mirroring how `ReconGroundExecutor`
  re-derives its own next step every turn too). Every *per-step* tactical decision — the
  Outbound/Turning/Hold/Return phase machine, live `ReconMode` resolution, the
  `ReconAirStepPlanner.Pick` call, the return-step + landing hysteresis, the activation energy /
  affordability gates and the opportunistic-strike arbitration — still lives in
  `Recon/AirReconStepDirector.PlanStep`, which replans live on every call; the tactical step-scoring
  algorithm itself (`AirReconRouteScorer` / `AirReconAnchorModel`) is unchanged this round — it does
  not take a bound target hex (see the round-4 report for why that was left as a documented, narrow,
  deliberate scope boundary rather than a rewrite). `Execution/ReconAirExecutor` only issues the
  canonical Move / Strike / assignment-bookkeeping call each returned `StepDecision` names and bumps
  `V2StateVersion` on each confirmed mutation; it produces an `AirReconExecutionResult`
  (`IV2ActionResult`). The orchestrator splits `TaskExecutor`'s ground/raid input from air-executed
  Scout `ProvisionedMission`s before calling `TaskExecutor.Execute`, then runs air plan+execute as a
  terminal stage; `TaskExecutor` itself still never references air recon. A launch that goes
  unaffordable mid-pass is skipped and logged, never re-planned.
* **Provisioning plays no strategic cards** — `Provisioning/*` binds actors and locks; it never
  calls `MaterializationExecutor` / `StrategicPhaseA/B`.
* **The strategic layer is skill-agnostic** — Strategy / Materialization / Missions / Reaction
  branch only on the AI's own `CapabilityKind` taxonomy, never on a gameplay ability name
  (`Splash` / `Regen` / `Summon` / `AbilityKind.*`). Ability specifics stay behind
  `StrategicEffectRegistry.Roles(...)`, so a new effect needs a registry entry, not a manager
  `if`.
* **Execution results are a structured family** — `MaterializationResult` / `CardPlayResult` /
  `BuildingPlayResult` / `InfraFulfillResult` / `ExecutionResult` / `AirReconExecutionResult`
  implement `IV2ActionResult` and project to the common `V2ActionOutcome` (`Succeeded` /
  `StateChanged` / `ApSpent` / `ResourcesSpent` / `Played` / `Generated` / `Attached` / `Moved` /
  `Created` / `NeedsReplan` / `StateVersionAfter` / `FailReason`). Each keeps its domain payload; a
  caller that only needs the lifecycle facts reads `.Outcome`. `MaterializationExecutor` measures
  the real H/E/M/T delta for `ResourcesSpent`; `BuildingPlayExecutor.BuildExtractionFacility`
  reports the facility definition's `resourceCost` and `InfraFulfillResult.Outcome.Played` is the
  real hand-card consumption (true for the DEV Facility card, false for the hero-built extraction
  site). (`ProvisioningResult` stays on its own `Success`/`Failure` shape — provisioning is §34,
  not §35 execution.)
* **One execution state-version counter** — `State/V2StateVersion`. It is bumped by every V2
  execution-tier operation that mutates authoritative world state: `CardPlayExecutor` /
  `BuildingPlayExecutor` / `MaterializationExecutor` / `TaskExecutor`, the air-recon executor
  (per confirmed move / launch / strike) and `StrategicPhaseB` tempo (Draw / capacity-upgrade /
  Pressure, which their own executors do not version). Phase B's parked-candidate lifecycle keys
  on `V2StateVersion.Current` directly — there is no second local counter.
